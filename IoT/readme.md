AWS IoT consists of:

- Device Gateway ~ this is a broker that handles MQTT, HTTP, and WS messaging
- Rules Engine ~ message router
- Rule Actions ~ handlers that react to certain messages
- Device Shadows ~ virtual copies of devices that remember device states; capable of updating devices when they come back online
- Build Solutions ~ UI frameworks and pre-built rigs for various devices.
